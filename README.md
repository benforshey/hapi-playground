# What is this?
It's a collection of plugins that I've built using hapi.js. This code is a reference for me (and you), but each plugin was built for a very specific purpose. In other words, this probably isn't general purpose code.

# Can I use any of this stuff in my app?
I make no promises as to code quality, but if you find any of this usefulâ€”awesome! Please use, improve, and profit.
